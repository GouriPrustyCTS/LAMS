Employee Leave and Attendance Management System (LAMS)

üöÄ Project Overview
The Employee Leave and Attendance Management System (LAMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to automate and streamline employee attendance tracking, leave request management, and working hour calculations. This system aims to provide a robust platform for both employees and managers, ensuring efficient workforce management and accurate record-keeping.

Leave Management: Facilitates requesting various leave types (sick, vacation, etc.) and tracking request statuses, with manager approval workflows.
Leave Balance: Automatically tracks and updates leave balances based on company policies and approved/rejected leaves.
Shift Management: Enables assignment of shifts to employees, along with options for viewing and swapping shifts with manager approval.
Reports & Analytics: Generates insightful reports on attendance trends, leave usage, and shift coverage to aid management decisions.
